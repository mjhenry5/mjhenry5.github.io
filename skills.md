### Skilled and certified in Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Access
### Proficient in Java, Python, SQL, Tableau, DAX, PowerBI, PowerPivot, and JMP

<p>I use Excel, Word, and PowerPoint almsot everyday as it pertains to school assignments. In Excel, I have experience creating charts, tables, pivot tables, pivot charts, predictive data models, time series models, regression models, simulation models, and hypothesis testing models.</p>

<p>Using Access, I created a database with applicable reports and forms to query and display mock data about a fake ski shop I created. This data carried through into SQL Server to create a database purely using code.</p>

<p>Using SQL, I created an OLTP database about the same ski shop, as well as created useable views, functions, and stored procedures to be used for reports and forms to give end users the information needed to answer relevant business questions. Later, I then created an OLAP datamart for that ski shopthat would allow for optimized reporting, the archival of historical data, and the ability to consolidate data from multiple sources. This process included the creation of a new OLAP datamart, the creation of an Extract Transform and Load process, and an analysis process using Power Pivot in Excel, as well as PowerBI to build reports and dashboards to fullfill business requirements set forth by the business.</p>

<p>Using Python, I coded predictive models from data using the almost endless libraries that the environemtn has to offer. This included hypothesis testing, simulation models, as well as the creation of visuals using Python.</p>

<p>Using JMP, I created many different types of predictive models from .csv files, including decision trees, clusters, neural networks, and regression models.</p>
