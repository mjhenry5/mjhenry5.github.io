## Clubs and Groups

### DU Club Kayaking

I am currently the treasurer of the DU Whitewater Kayaking club. As a club we teach members the basics of whitewater kayaking in our school pool. We then take them out on trips around Colorado to experience real rivers and to build their skills even more. I joined the club as a freshman, and have thoroughly enjoyed my time leading, team building, and teaching within the club. 

## Hobbies

My hobbies include downhill skiing, whitewater kayaking, mountain biking, hiking, and music production.
