# Work Experience

## Charles Schwab

At Charles Schwab, I worked as an intern on the Password Reset line as one of the first points of contact for customer service for clients. I learned a lot about the financial sector, as well as what it truly means to provide meaningful customer service over the phone. 

## Ameristar Black Hawk

At Ameristar, I learned about the casino industry, as well as gained a holistic review of the entire operation. I spent time in every department of the property, and was even able to visit other properties to see the differences in function. I worked on several marketing projects, audit projects, and was able to provide customer service on the floor for casino guests. This was a great experience and it painted a picture of the decision making process that upper level management has to go through when solving problems for a large company.

## UPS

At UPS I worked as a pre-load package handler, loading UPS package trucks in the early hours of the morning. This experience was grueling, but fun at the same time by being able to see the sheer amount of packages that come through one warehouse in a single day. 

## Demoulas Market Basket

At Market Basket, I worked as a Dairy Clerk stocking food items and providing customer service. At Market Basket I was able to work with a team towards a commmon goal and this job helped me to develop as an employee by being professional and calm in stressful situations.

## Staples

My first job was at Stables as a sales associate. I worked the front register, stocked product, and provided customer service to all customers entering the store. At Staples, I learned how important customer service is to having people come back, and even saw many repeat customers come back due to the service we provided.
